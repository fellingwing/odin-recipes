This is a project made for The Odin Project, an online course which seeks to make beginners into full-stack developers.

The Recipes project is used to get me familiar with basic HTML text, image, and hyperlink syntax. Also, it is used to get me familiar with git commands, so I can upload this project onto a remote repository (GitHub).
