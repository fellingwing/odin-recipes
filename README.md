This is a project made for The Odin Project, an online course which seeks to make beginners into full-stack developers.

The Odin Recipes Project is a basic website which links to webpages containing recipes. Recipes are taken from https://www.allrecipes.com/recipes/84/healthy-recipes/

The Recipes project is used to get me familiar with basic HTML text, image, and hyperlink syntax. Also, it is used to get me familiar with git commands, so I can upload this project onto a remote repository (GitHub).
