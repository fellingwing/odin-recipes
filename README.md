This is a project made for The Odin Project, an online course which makes beginners into full-stack developers.

The Odin Recipes Project is a basic website which links to webpages containing recipes. Recipes are taken from https://www.allrecipes.com/recipes/84/healthy-recipes/

The Recipes project is used to get me familiar with basic HTML text, the basic CSS box model, image, and hyperlink syntax. Also, it is used to get me familiar with git commands, so I can upload this project onto a remote repository (GitHub).
